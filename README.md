Unfortunatelly not all animations can be loaded using this readed. Please check this list of points below. If all of the points fits your fbx file then more chanses it can be readed using this asset.
* fbx version 7400 or higher
* binary file
* one mesh in file (not strict)
* one animation in file (not strict)
* animation only skeletal (not strict)

I tested this asset only using fbx 7400 version exported from Blender.
Code written using GMEdit.
